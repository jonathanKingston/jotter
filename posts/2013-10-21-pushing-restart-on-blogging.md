I have been inspired to write blogs over the years, without ever making more than several posts before quitting.

A post by Joe Armstrong hit home and made me realise I should just get on and start writing:
[Joe Armstrong - Jekyll is great](http://joearms.github.io/2013/03/28/jekyll-is-great.html)

I'm not expecting to have much interest however: man needs a place to rant.

This is what I will be using this blog for mainly ranting and perhaps some talk about development.
